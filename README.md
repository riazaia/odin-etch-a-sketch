# Pixelite

> A web-based application for drawing small pixel sprites.

Pixelite was inspired by The Odin Project's (TOP) suggested excercise to build a toy similar to an etch-a-sketch. I wanted a quick and easy way to make small 16x16 pixel sprites without having to download a standalone program and some of the features were inspired by the TOP curriculum.
